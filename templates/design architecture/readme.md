## Software Requirements Specification

- description of a software system to be developed
- aka requirements written down so we could:

  - describe the scope of work
  - provide references to software designers
  - provide framework for testing primary and secondary use cases
  - links features to customer requirements
  - platform for ongoing refinement

## Tips for writing requirements

- is this something people would care about?
- is this obvious or do I need to spell it out?
- did I make my reasons and how I came about them clear?
- will this prevent contention regarding implementation details in the future?
- does this contribute to my peers?
